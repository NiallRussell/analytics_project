# Analysis of Palmer's Penguins Dataset
This dataset contains data on 344 penguins of three different species: Adelie, Chinstrap and Gentoo. 

Penguins were observed on three different islands of the Palmer Archipelago, Antartica: Biscoe, Dream and Torgersen, and data were collected on each penguin's body mass, flipper length, and bill length and depth


## About this Project
This repository includes a Jupyter notebook which summarizes each variable. Counts are shown for each categorical variable and a bar chart is presented for species count, showing that Adelie is the species which appears most frequently in the dataset, followed by Chinstrap and finally, Gentoo

Descriptive statistics are presented for scale variables and a histogram is presented for body mass, showing a normal distribution with a slightly positive skew. 

Lastly, a correlation analysis is performed between bill length and flipper length, finding a positive, statistically significant correlation. A scatter plot is presented to visualize their relationship.

## Use of this Project
This project can be used to obtain an overview of the variables in the Palmer Penguins dataset.
